--Game of Thrones Game--

- The objective of this game is to score 6 points by eliminating the proper 
    characaters off of the board by clicking on them. All of the good 
    characters (except the dire wolf, which will lose you 5 points) remove 
    1 point each. All of the bad characters (except Hillary Clinton, who 
    is worth 5 points) will earn you 1 point each. You must earn at least 6
    of possible 11 points within the 60 second timer to win.

-User Stories-
    Upon playing the game, the player is presented with a series of characters 
    from Game of Thrones. For each character clicked, a message is displayed
    in a text box, and the score is updated. The game must be executed quickly, 
    as there is a 60 second time limit. When the clock runs out, a win or lose
    message is displayed and the game restarts after 5 seconds.
